            <p>My name is Ketsarin Kayak. In 2019 I move from Thailand to Seattle USA. 
                I have been server for about 7 years before I have my own Thai restaurant name Appethaizing. <br/>
                I ran my business about 4 years with doing very good and I sold my business because I want to have family.<br/>
               After I sold busness I went back to full stack coding program school . I like it<br/>
                I though I should use my both knowledge with Asian food receipt and coding to make website.</p>
